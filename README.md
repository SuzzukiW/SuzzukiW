# Welcome!

**I'm SuzzukiW. I can build many things but also break them.**

Currently ambitiously (and perhaps a tad recklessly) teaching computers to think, see, and do like a human.

This semester, I've plunged headfirst into the cryptic world of Cryptography in computing and data sciences, dabbling in the dark arts of secret messages and uncrackable codes. Meanwhile, in Computational Linguistics, I'm playing the modern-day oracle, predicting what you're going to say next before even you know it!

- [Cryptography for Data Science](https://github.com/SuzzukiW/ds453-crypto-for-data-science): Where I channel my inner spy to secure the digital realm.
- [Computational Linguistics](https://github.com/SuzzukiW/lx496-computational-linguistics): Where I attempt to decode the babble of the human race.
